# Emulation_GP_PCE
Code and data for the paper "A comparison of Gaussian processes and polynomial chaos emulators in the context of haemodynamic pulse-wave propagation modelling" by L. Mihaela Paun, Mitchel J. Colebank, Dirk Husmeier

To create data files, Simulators are run.

To build GP emulators, the Matlab toolboxes GPstuff-4.7 and gpstuff-develop are needed.

To build PCE, the toolbox UQlab in Matlab is required.
